## About (twitter for Gameboy)
Twitter for gameboy is a social spin on the Defcon 32 Badge game, incorporating different elements of infosec culture. 

### Currently, 
it's a walkable, interactive timeline. It's a little bit cute art. It's a cookbook. It's a place to learn and a social feed you can actually get to the end of, and then go on with your life. 

### Coming Soon, 
- educational content from the villages and individuals
- resources for noobs
- challenges / contests
- collaborative art
- interactive short stories and poems
- real democracy
- events calendar
- community bulletin board

### To get to the "feed",
just use the toilet in your hotel room or find the twitter option in your start menu. 

This is the safest social media network ever because if you make a post it could take several days before anyone sees it. 

### In the future,
There will be multiple ways this game is made socially interactive. Think leaving notes for one another, or collaborative art. The input methods for this will be through github, or by scanning QR codes on your phone to take you elsewhere. 

I encourage others to add their changes within this repository so that we can grow the game as a community. 

Despite the name, you don't need a twitter. Github is your twitter now. Add your pixel art here for me to incorporate into the game, or design your own space / scene in the GB Studio! leave a tweet, or simply just leave a short note for a friend in the document made for that. Finally, a way you can earn your green squares that you actually feel good about.  

I am getting the hang of tools and processes still so this is very early days and all done manually. I would like to automate a component of this later, by pulling in selected posts from twitter and converting them to gameboy art. 


### Privacy / Safety / Impersonation
you don't know who anyone is online, especially not in a social media game for gameboy. Don't take it too seriously, it's a game, but also don't be an asshole. Don't impersonate or speak on someone else's behalf unless it is true or very funny.

I don't want to write a longer policy than this right now. seriously please don't be weird or shitty.
