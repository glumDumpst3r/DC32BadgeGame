from the tweet folder, fill out the tweetRequestTemplate, and save the request here. 

Requests will be taken from this folder to add tweets into the game. 

If you don't feel like tweeting your own tweets, you can always make someone else's tweet into gameboy art and earn your green square on github for the day.  

Take a request from here and make it into art using the design assets provided, then save it into the completedTweets folder.
